						"Air-Line Management System"

Here we can use Singelton pattern:

It has Centralized Control, Global Access,Resources management.

we can use microservices arch to fetch avaliability of flights.



->API Gateway
  An API Gateway is a single entry point for clients (mobile apps, web apps, etc.) to interact with the microservices. 
  The API Gateway is responsible for routing requests to the appropriate microservices and can also handle additional functionality like 
  authentication, rate limiting, logging, and more.

  API Gateway: You can use Spring Cloud Gateway or Zuul as the API Gateway.
  This helps reduce the number of direct interactions between clients and services and can aggregate responses from multiple microservices 
into a single response.

-> explaining the flow:
	A user requests to book a flight.
	The API Gateway routes the request to the Booking Service.
	The Booking Service checks flight availability and confirms the booking.
	If payment is required, the Booking Service calls the Payment Service via its API.
	The Payment Service processes the payment and returns the result to the Booking Service.
	The Booking Service notifies the Notification Service, which sends a confirmation to the passenger.
